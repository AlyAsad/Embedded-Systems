# CENG336 Assignments

The collection of assignments I completed in my CENG336 Embedded Systems course, especially programmed for the PIC18F8722 microcontroller.

All assignments are done in MPLAB X IDE. THE1 is implemented in assembly, THE2 and THE3 are implemented in C.

THE: Take Home Exam

Side note: I misplaced my solution for THE2.
